# games-server
Provide the service for the "games" project.

# About
Uses FastAPI and sqlite.  The "setup" jupyter notebook, if you just execute the cells in order, will scrape Wikiquotes for quotes and create a "pap.db" for you which you can use to run the service.

# Testing
There currently exist rudimentary tests for the PlayerCache and a LoadTest, also in a notebook.
